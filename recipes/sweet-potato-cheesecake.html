    <br><h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C ).</li>
        <br><li>Mix graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1/4 cup melted butter together in a bowl until combined. Press crumb mixture firmly and evenly across the bottom and slightly up the sides of a 9 ½-inch springform pan. Bake for 10 minutes; remove from oven and set aside. Keep the oven on.</li>
        <br><li>Beat cream cheese and 7/8 cup of white sugar until smooth. Mix in sour cream, 1/4 cup cream, and sweet potato puree. Beat in eggs one at a time, blending well after each. Pour filling into crust.</li>
        <br><li>Bake in the preheated oven until a tester inserted near the center comes out clean, about 1 hour (center may still be slightly jiggly). Turn off the oven. Let cake stand 1 hour in oven with door ajar.</li>
        <br><li>To make the praline topping: Combine brown sugar and 1/4 cup butter in a heavy small saucepan. Stir over low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat, and bring to a boil. Mix in 1/4 cup cream, then add pecans.</li>
        <br><li>Pour hot praline topping over cheesecake. Store leftover cheesecake in the refrigerator.</li>
        <br><li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
