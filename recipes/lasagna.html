        <li class="bgc">salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li class="bgc">24 wonton wrappers</li>
        <li class="bgc">1 3/4 cups grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li class="bgc">1 3/4 cups shredded Mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li class="bgc">3/4 cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li class="bgc">1 cup pasta sauce (homemade or store bought)</li>
        <li class="bgc">1/4 cup chopped basil(optional)</li>
    

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li class="bgc">Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare muffin cups with cooking spray.</li>
        <li class="bgc">Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Drain and discard grease from beef.</li>
        <li class="bgc">Cut wonton wrappers into 2 1/4-inch circles with a biscuit cutter. Press one wonton into the bottom of each muffin cup. Sprinkle even amounts of Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, and ricotta cheese into each muffin cup; top each portion with even amounts of ground beef and pasta sauce.</li>
        <li class="bgc">Divide 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese,  1/2 of the ricotta cheese, 1/2 of the ground beef mixture, and 1/2 cup pasta sauce, between the muffin cups and layer, respectively, atop wonton wrapper; repeat layering with remaining wonton wrappers, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, remaining ricotta cheese, remaining ground beef, and remaining pasta sauce. Top "cupcakes" with remaining Parmesan cheese and mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li class="bgc">Bake in preheated oven until edges of "cupcakes" are browned, 18 to 20 minutes; let rest in tins for 5 minutes before running a knife around the edges to loosen and remove. Garnish with fresh basil to serve.</li>
